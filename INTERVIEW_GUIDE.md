## üîß **Technical Deep Dive Questions & Answers**

### **1. "Walk me through your technical architecture"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented a three-tier architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: React SPA with TailwindCSS for styling, using functional components and hooks for state management
- **Backend**: Flask REST API with Pandas for data processing and a custom scoring engine
- **Data Layer**: CSV files with Pandas for data manipulation (designed to be easily replaceable with a database)

The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful endpoints, and I implemented proper CORS handling for cross-origin requests. The scoring algorithm runs server-side for security and consistency."

### **2. "Explain your AI scoring algorithm"**

**Answer:**
"I developed a multi-factor scoring system that evaluates leads across 5 dimensions:

1. **Industry Potential (0-25 points)**: SaaS/Tech get 25 points, Finance gets 20, Healthcare 15, etc.
2. **Company Revenue (0-25 points)**: $50M+ gets 25 points, scaling down to $1M+ for 5 points
3. **Contact Quality (0-20 points)**: Corporate emails get 15 points, business emails 12, plus phone validation
4. **Geographic Market (0-15 points)**: US gets 15 points, Tier 1 markets like Canada/UK get 12
5. **Data Completeness (0-15 points)**: Required fields (10pts) + optional fields (5pts)

I also added a bonus system for high-value tech companies in Tier 1 markets. The algorithm is designed to be transparent and explainable, which is important for business stakeholders."

### **3. "How did you handle data processing and serialization?"**

**Answer:**
"I used Pandas for efficient data manipulation, but encountered a key challenge with JSON serialization. Pandas DataFrames contain NaN values that aren't JSON serializable. I solved this by:

```python
# Replace NaN values with None for proper JSON serialization
df = df.where(pd.notna(df), None)
```

I also implemented proper error handling for edge cases like missing files, malformed data, and API failures. The backend returns consistent JSON responses with appropriate HTTP status codes."

### **4. "Describe your frontend architecture and component design"**

**Answer:**
"I used React functional components with hooks for state management. The architecture follows a clear hierarchy:

- **Dashboard**: Main container managing global state
- **FilterBar**: Handles search and filtering logic
- **LeadTable**: Displays data with sorting and pagination
- **ScoreBadge**: Reusable component for visual score indicators
- **InsightsChart**: Data visualization component

I implemented proper prop drilling and used useEffect for API calls. The UI is responsive with TailwindCSS, using a mobile-first approach and ensuring accessibility compliance."

### **5. "How did you solve the CORS problem?"**

**Answer:**
"CORS was a significant challenge since the frontend and backend run on different ports. I configured Flask-CORS to allow cross-origin requests:

```python
from flask_cors import CORS
CORS(app, origins=['http://localhost:3000', 'http://localhost:5173'])
```

I also added proper headers for preflight requests and ensured all API endpoints return appropriate CORS headers. This allows the React frontend to communicate with the Flask backend seamlessly."

### **6. "What was your deployment strategy?"**

**Answer:**
"I designed the application for multiple deployment scenarios:

**Development**: Local setup with separate frontend/backend servers
**Production Options**: 
- Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages
- Backend: Render, Heroku, or AWS EC2
- Database: Currently CSV, but designed for easy PostgreSQL migration

I also created a standalone HTML version using CDN resources for zero-dependency deployment. The project includes comprehensive documentation for all deployment methods."

## üé® **Frontend-Specific Questions**

### **7. "How did you handle state management?"**

**Answer:**
"I used React's built-in useState and useEffect hooks for state management. The main Dashboard component manages:
- Lead data state
- Filter states (industry, region, score)
- Loading and error states
- Sort configuration

I avoided external state management libraries since the application state was relatively simple. For larger applications, I'd consider Redux or Context API."

### **8. "Explain your responsive design approach"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented a mobile-first responsive design using TailwindCSS breakpoints:
- Mobile: <768px with stacked layouts
- Tablet: 768px-1024px with adjusted spacing
- Desktop: >1024px with full feature set

Key responsive features include:
- Collapsible navigation on mobile
- Horizontal scrolling for data tables
- Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
- Optimized typography scaling"

### **9. "How did you handle loading states and error handling?"**

**Answer:**
"I implemented comprehensive loading and error states:
- **Loading**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry options
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no data is available

The frontend gracefully handles API failures and provides fallback UI elements. I also implemented proper error boundaries for React components."

- **Learning Curve**: Faster to set up and deploy
- **Microservices Ready**: Could easily extract into separate services

For larger applications with complex user management, I'd consider Django. But Flask was ideal for this focused lead scoring API."

### **11. "How did you structure your API endpoints?"**

**Answer:**
"I followed RESTful principles with two main endpoints:

**GET /api/leads**: Retrieves all leads with optional query parameters for filtering
- Query params: industry, region, min_score
- Returns: Array of lead objects with scores

**POST /api/score**: Scores a single lead object
- Request body: Lead data object
- Returns: Computed score

I implemented proper HTTP status codes, error handling, and consistent JSON response formats."

### **12. "Explain your data processing pipeline"**

**Answer:**
"The data processing pipeline follows these steps:
1. **Load**: Read CSV file using Pandas
2. **Clean**: Handle NaN values and data validation
3. **Score**: Apply multi-factor algorithm to each lead
4. **Filter**: Apply query parameters if provided
5. **Serialize**: Convert to JSON with proper formatting
6. **Return**: Send HTTP response with appropriate headers

I used Pandas for efficient data manipulation and implemented caching for better performance with large datasets."
